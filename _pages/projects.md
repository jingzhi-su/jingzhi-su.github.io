## [RookieDB](https://cs186.gitbook.io/project)
Engineered a modular database management system featuring B+ tree indexing, query processing, join optimization, multigranularity locking, and recovery mechanisms. Tackled algorithmic challenges to ensure efficient queries and improved performance for reliable transaction handling.


## [Diffusion](https://jingzhi-su.github.io/CS180/project5/)

Investigated diffusion-based image generation methods, implementing sampling loops, inpainting, image-to-image translation, and optical illusions. Trained conditioned diffusion models on MNIST to study the effects of time and class embeddings on output.

## [Image Quilting](https://jingzhi-su.github.io/CS180/project6/)

Explored texture synthesis and transfer methods from [Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/research/quilting/quilting.pdf) by Efros A., & Freeman W.

## [Light Field Camera](https://jingzhi-su.github.io/CS180/project6/)

Implemented Light Field Photography based on Ng et al.â€™s [Light Field Photography with a Hand-held Plenoptic Camera](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/lfcamera/lfcamera-150dpi.pdf) paper, enabling post-capture refocusing and perspective shift from a single image capture.

## [Auto-Stitching Photo Mosaics](https://jingzhi-su.github.io/CS180/project4/)

Built an auto-stitching system for panoramic images using Harris Corner Detection, Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression, and RANSAC for feature matching, with projective warping and bilinear interpolation for seamless blending.

## [Face Morphing](https://jingzhi-su.github.io/CS180/project3/)

Used Delaunay triangulation and affine transformations to morph faces!

## [Image Filtering and Frequency Analysis](https://jingzhi-su.github.io/CS180/project2/)

Implemented image processing techniques including edge detection, filtering, frequency analysis, and Laplacian/Gaussian stacks to enhance images, create hybrid images, and perform multiresolution blending.

## [Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection](https://jingzhi-su.github.io/CS180/project1/)

Constructed an image pyramid alignment algorithm with automatic cropping to reconstruct and colorize historical photos of the Russian Empire.

## [Adversarial Machine Learning](/assets/docs/EECS_127_Project.pdf)

Explored methods to make neural network classifiers more robust by framing training as a non-convex optimization problem. Leveraged techniques from [Wong and Kolter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00851) to mathematically analyze and certify robustness against input perturbations.

## [Gitlet](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2)

Built a lightweight version control system inspired by Git to manage project versions and track changes efficiently. Implemented core functionality including committing and restoring snapshots, branching and merging with conflict detection, and viewing project history.

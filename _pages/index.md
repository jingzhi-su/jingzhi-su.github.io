Hello! I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science. Currently, I am working as a Software Development Engineer under the Commerce Data Platform team at Adobe.

Previously, I interned with Adobe’s Commerce Catalog team, where I worked on developing protocols between microservices. I’ve also interned at Esperanto Technologies on the Silicon Engineering team, focusing on building testing software.

Outside of work, I love to exercise, explore new places, and keep up with basketball! Go Heat🔥! I’m always curious to learn new things, and this site is where I share what I’ve learned through my projects and experiences. Thanks for stopping by👋
